# What it does?
Utilizing the cutting-edge Llama-Index, our platform provides a robust and dynamic assessment of a company's environmental impact. Firstly, we extract unstructured data from Wikipedia from **LlamaIndex** data loaders. Next, we performing chunking/segmentation to chunk the long-context data and store the data in **MongoDB vectorstore**. Finally, given a query we performing LlamaIndex recursive retrieval + document agent architecture to route the query to the most relevant document agent. Finally, we pass the relevant chunks to **Llama2** from **Together AI** for efficient question answering.
